This code simulates working of a library management system
It allows user to perform the following operations :
	
	-Add books
	-Display list of books
	-Search books by name or ID
	-Delete entries
	-Edit entries
	-Issue books
	-View books issued
	-Return books

The interface is the console itself

The 'NCurses' library has been used for adding color and modifying text output

All comments and suggestions are welcome :)
